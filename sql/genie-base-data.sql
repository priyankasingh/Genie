We are a friendly, mixed choir who meet on Wednesday evenings in the Jubilee Room and aim to put on two performances a year, a Sing-Along Coffee Morning in the spring, and a Christmas concert. Art - The Art Group is a club rather than a class ranging from beginners to professionals and we all enjoy learning from each other. Watercolour is our main media but many members also use acrylics, pastels, pen and wash, and water based oils. Today we have over 70 members meeting twice a week on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings from 9.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. Bowling - Outdoor Bowling commences after Easter on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoons from 1.30pm until approximately 4.30pm. Indoor bowling takes place from September through till Easter on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoons from 1.30pm and Sunday mornings from 10.00am.

Digital Photography - Our meetings are normally held in the Lesser Hall on the third Tuesday of the month, commencing at 7.30pm with an informal Question and Answer session to help all members of the Group with any aspect of their photography. This is followed by a variety of photography topics at 8.00pm. Gardening - The activities are varied, being made up of Coffee Mornings, combined with competitions and social evenings. Linguist - Made up of 5 groups. The Linguists’ Section is managed by a dedicated and enthusiastic committee who arrange a number of social events for all club members during the year.  These range from coffee mornings and tea afternoons to talks, slideshows, dinners and entertainment.  Sometimes the entertainment is provided by the Linguists themselves. Rambling - We organise 2 events per month – one ramble and one stroll. Theatre - Are you a wannabee actor? Brookdale Theatre is always on the lookout for talented actors and actresses to take part in the 5 productions we hold each year with auditions normally held in May/June. We aim to have a varied programme throughout our season (October- May). Travel - We meet socially on the third Friday of most months, with the exception of July and August, mainly for a varied programme of talks on travel related subjects. In addition to our indoor meetings we arrange tours, trips and visits, as suggested by the committee or members themselves, when sufficient numbers are involved to make them viable propositions. Generally these trips run once a month during Spring and Summer. Walrus - The Walrus Section/ Society began its life some 30 plus years ago and was formed so that Members who had ceased an active business life i.e. retired or otherwise, could meet together at the Clubhouse each month to chat together in the Bar Lounge for a budget priced Lunch and enjoy a Speaker as well and Wine - Whilst the Society still holds wine making competitions, it has developed more into a wine and food appreciation Society we hold popular wine tastings at regular intervals plus talks on food, along with a wide range of topics of general interest.

Generally these trips run once a month during Spring and Summer. Walrus - The Walrus Section/ Society began its life some 30 plus years ago and was formed so that Members who had ceased an active business life i.e. retired or otherwise, could meet together at the Clubhouse each month to chat together in the Bar Lounge for a budget priced Lunch and enjoy a Speaker as well and Wine - Whilst the Society still holds wine making competitions, it has developed more into a wine and food appreciation Society we hold popular wine tastings at regular intervals plus talks on food, along with a wide range of topics of general interest.

We aim to do this by organising monthly Sunday afternoon tea parties for small groups of older people (aged 75+) who live alone, and volunteers within their local community, offering a regular and vital friendship link every month. Each older person is collected from their home by a volunteer driver and taken to a volunteer host’s home for the afternoon. The group is warmly welcomed by a different host each month, but the drivers remain the same which means that over the months and years, acquaintances turn into friends and loneliness is replaced by companionship. Our tea parties are a real lifeline of friendship for our older members who have little or no contact with any family or friends. They bring people of all ages together, develop fulfilling friendships and support networks, and give everyone involved something to look forward to each month.',NULL,NULL,NULL,1,150,1,1,53.497848,-2.318776,'eng','2013-05-20 12:00:00','2013-05-20 12:00:00',NULL,NULL,'contact-the-elderly'),(191,'Bolton Cardiac Support Service','Mr David Houghton ','Friends Meeting House','Silverwell Street',NULL,'Bolton','BL1 1PP','01204 300661',NULL,'http://www.boltoncardiacsupportService.org','The Bolton Cardiac Support Service (BCSG) meets at the Friends Meeting House every third Wednesday to offer friendship and support to people who are experiencing or recovering from some form of coronary (heart) illness such as angina, heart attack, heart surgery or ischemic heart disease.

Having meals delivered to your home may help to keep you independent. Attending a luncheon club gives you the opportunity to socialise and meet with other people outside the home. A variety of nutritionally balanced meals are delivered. The meals can be: hot - delivered by Adult Services staff, between 11.30 am and 1.30pm daily, frozen - delivered by a private Company, weekly, fortnightly or monthly, suit special diets - including diabetic, vegetarian, low salt, low fat and gluten free, fit in with cultural needs - including Asian Vegetarian, Asian Halal, Kosher, Caribbean, West Indian, Middle and Far Eastern and African. There is a small charge for your meal, including sweet. You pay by settling a monthly bill. The current cost of a community meal at home or at a Luncheon Club is: £3.00. The first step is to contact the Older People\'s Helpdesk (using the Contact details tab above) and consider the measures we use to decide if people qualify (eligibility criteria). Not everyone will be entitled to receive meals. You will be asked various questions and if after discussion, you qualify for meals, a member of staff from the community meals team will contact you by phone to discuss the type of meals you require and set the service up.',NULL,'boltoncouncil','https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bolton-Council/102011083185130',1,150,1,1,53.578098,-2.430875,'eng','2013-05-20 12:00:00','2013-05-20 12:00:00',NULL,NULL,'community-meals-bolton-council'),(412,'Home Instead Senior Care Bolton','David Deller','Office 18 112A-116','Hamill House','Chorley New Road','Bolton','BL1 4DH','01204 498949','david.deller@homeinstead.co.uk','http://www.homeinstead.co.uk/bolton','Home Instead Senior Care provides quality care for people in their own homes.

It&#39;s fun and free and an opportunity to get out and meet people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SingAbout is based on the &lsquo;Singing for the Brain&rsquo; therapy, which was developed specifically for people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other dementia sufferers, as well as people whose brain functions are affected perhaps by a stroke or injury. &#39;Singing for the Brain&rsquo; is a trademarked therapy which has gained much recognition through studies undertaken with patients. It is recognised by the NHS as the most effective form of complementary therapy for this group and it works by stimulating, improving and maintaining the brain&rsquo;s neurological pathways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our SingAbout sessions, led by experienced practitioners, have a wider benefit to both carers and participants by providing group activity and encouraging social interaction. The sessions require group participation, and sometimes songs will be sung in rounds. Many of the songs require gentle hand actions or chair-based movements. Some are specifically chosen to invoke memories; some are previously unknown so participants are encouraged to memorise the words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No musical background is necessary so come along and try it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n','Weekly on a Monday from 2 -4 p.m','','',1,150,1,1,50.727324,-1.16922210000007,'eng','2014-08-11 00:20:30','2014-09-04 16:45:17',NULL,NULL,'independent-arts-singabout-1'),(684,'Island Flower Club','Kate Newcombe','Wootton Bridge Community Centre','Brannon Way ','Wootton Bridge ','Wootton','PO33 4NW','01983 564369','sue.gibbons@hotmail.com','http://www.nafas.org.uk/flower_club/Island+Flower+Club+(Ryde).html','','2nd Wed of each month at 2pm.

Large numbers of players attend both Clubs, and both Clubs have had to find solutions to the same sorts of problems when deciding on their playing formats, so it should not be surprising that both are very similar. Both meet at 7.15pm for a 7.30pm start, the Ryde Club on a Monday evening, and the Newport Club on a Tuesday. Both play three games of Scrabble until 10pm. Both contain two main groups; an &quot;A&quot; group, playing &quot;Matchplay&quot; Scrabble using tournament rules taken from the ABSP, and a &quot;B&quot; group playing less competitive Scrabble for beginners, or simply for the more socially-minded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teams from both clubs take part in the Southern Counties&rsquo; League.</p>\r\n','every Monday evening, at 7.15pm ready for a 7.30 start','','',1,150,1,1,50.729454,-1.16150489999995,'eng','2014-08-11 17:36:20','2014-09-04 14:16:59',NULL,NULL,'scrabble-club'),(722,'Bembridge Afternoon TownsWomen  Guild','Mrs H Ransome','Bembridge Village Hall','High Street','','Bembridge','PO35 5XN','01983 874241','','','<p>The Isle of Wight Federation meets bi-monthly on the 4th Monday 10.15am at the Broadway Centre, Sandown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Federation, as well as supporting the eleven Island Guilds, hosts annually an Arts &amp; Crafts Exhibition, an inter-guild Quiz, both a Luncheon and a Christmas Concert.

We are a friendly, mixed choir who meet on Wednesday evenings in the Jubilee Room and aim to put on two performances a year, a Sing-Along Coffee Morning in the spring, and a Christmas concert. Art - The Art Group is a club rather than a class ranging from beginners to professionals and we all enjoy learning from each other. Watercolour is our main media but many members also use acrylics, pastels, pen and wash, and water based oils. Today we have over 70 members meeting twice a week on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings from 9.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. Bowling - Outdoor Bowling commences after Easter on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoons from 1.30pm until approximately 4.30pm. Indoor bowling takes place from September through till Easter on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoons from 1.30pm and Sunday mornings from 10.00am.

Caracamp - The Caracamp Section is a very friendly group of Brookdale members with touring caravans and motor homes. Dancing - This Friendly section meets every Wednesday evening from September until the last week in July for Modern Sequence dancing. Digital Photography - Our meetings are normally held in the Lesser Hall on the third Tuesday of the month, commencing at 7.30pm with an informal Question and Answer session to help all members of the Group with any aspect of their photography. This is followed by a variety of photography topics at 8.00pm. Gardening - The activities are varied, being made up of Coffee Mornings, combined with competitions and social evenings. Linguist - Made up of 5 groups. The Linguists’ Section is managed by a dedicated and enthusiastic committee who arrange a number of social events for all club members during the year.  These range from coffee mornings and tea afternoons to talks, slideshows, dinners and entertainment.  Sometimes the entertainment is provided by the Linguists themselves. Rambling - We organise 2 events per month – one ramble and one stroll. Theatre - Are you a wannabee actor? Brookdale Theatre is always on the lookout for talented actors and actresses to take part in the 5 productions we hold each year with auditions normally held in May/June. We aim to have a varied programme throughout our season (October- May). Travel - We meet socially on the third Friday of most months, with the exception of July and August, mainly for a varied programme of talks on travel related subjects. In addition to our indoor meetings we arrange tours, trips and visits, as suggested by the committee or members themselves, when sufficient numbers are involved to make them viable propositions. Generally these trips run once a month during Spring and Summer. Walrus - The Walrus Section/ Society began its life some 30 plus years ago and was formed so that Members who had ceased an active business life i.e. retired or otherwise, could meet together at the Clubhouse each month to chat together in the Bar Lounge for a budget priced Lunch and enjoy a Speaker as well and Wine - Whilst the Society still holds wine making competitions, it has developed more into a wine and food appreciation Society we hold popular wine tastings at regular intervals plus talks on food, along with a wide range of topics of general interest. Annual party nights, when we have dinner, plus entertainment and our Vice President’s evening when strawberries and cream with wine are served, also accompanied by entertainment are very popular.',NULL,'brookdaleclub','https://www.facebook.com/groups/281290235267551/',1,150,1,1,53.38381,-2.16335,'eng','2013-05-20 12:00:00','2013-05-20 12:00:00',NULL,NULL,'the-brookdale-club',NULL,NULL,'2015-03-05 16:03:00'),(62,88,'Well Being Centre','Charlotte Baxter','Graylaw House','Chestergate',NULL,'Stockport','SK1 1LZ','0161 4747713','charlotte.baxter@stockportmind.org.uk',NULL,'Set in the centre of Stockport, the Well Being Centre is a one stop shop for anyone wanting to access a variety of health and well being services.

In addition to our indoor meetings we arrange tours, trips and visits, as suggested by the committee or members themselves, when sufficient numbers are involved to make them viable propositions. Generally these trips run once a month during Spring and Summer. Walrus - The Walrus Section/ Society began its life some 30 plus years ago and was formed so that Members who had ceased an active business life i.e. retired or otherwise, could meet together at the Clubhouse each month to chat together in the Bar Lounge for a budget priced Lunch and enjoy a Speaker as well and Wine - Whilst the Society still holds wine making competitions, it has developed more into a wine and food appreciation Society we hold popular wine tastings at regular intervals plus talks on food, along with a wide range of topics of general interest.

Activities include Andante - If you enjoy singing in harmony, and would like the opportunity to do so on a regular basis, then Andante may well be for you. We are a friendly, mixed choir who meet on Wednesday evenings in the Jubilee Room and aim to put on two performances a year, a Sing-Along Coffee Morning in the spring, and a Christmas concert. Art - The Art Group is a club rather than a class ranging from beginners to professionals and we all enjoy learning from each other. Watercolour is our main media but many members also use acrylics, pastels, pen and wash, and water based oils. Today we have over 70 members meeting twice a week on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings from 9.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. Bowling - Outdoor Bowling commences after Easter on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoons from 1.30pm until approximately 4.30pm. Indoor bowling takes place from September through till Easter on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoons from 1.30pm and Sunday mornings from 10.00am. Brigde - The weekly programme of events include Rubber and Duplicate Bridge sessions with teams of Four held in the Winter.  Caracamp - The Caracamp Section is a very friendly group of Brookdale members with touring caravans and motor homes. Dancing - This Friendly section meets every Wednesday evening from September until the last week in July for Modern Sequence dancing. Digital Photography - Our meetings are normally held in the Lesser Hall on the third Tuesday of the month, commencing at 7.30pm with an informal Question and Answer session to help all members of the Group with any aspect of their photography. This is followed by a variety of photography topics at 8.00pm. Gardening - The activities are varied, being made up of Coffee Mornings, combined with competitions and social evenings. Linguist - Made up of 5 groups. The Linguists’ Section is managed by a dedicated and enthusiastic committee who arrange a number of social events for all club members during the year.  These range from coffee mornings and tea afternoons to talks, slideshows, dinners and entertainment.  Sometimes the entertainment is provided by the Linguists themselves. Rambling - We organise 2 events per month – one ramble and one stroll. Theatre - Are you a wannabee actor? Brookdale Theatre is always on the lookout for talented actors and actresses to take part in the 5 productions we hold each year with auditions normally held in May/June. We aim to have a varied programme throughout our season (October- May). Travel - We meet socially on the third Friday of most months, with the exception of July and August, mainly for a varied programme of talks on travel related subjects.

YOU can get involved in lots of different ways, as little or as much as you like to ensure older people’s voices are heard and to discuss, express and develop views on a wide range of social issues, needs and services. You can join the Forum as an individual or be a representative of your community group – to input into the Forum the issues that arise within your social group; distribute information, gather views from your group members, neighbours, and peers. You can also be part of a task group – these can vary according to the need that exists focusing around various areas such as, transport, health, disability, intergenerational work, diversity, communications and could involve attending relevant conferences, consultations and meetings. In return you will receive regular updates from the Forum through a newsletter, opportunities to be involved in large scale consultations, the chance to join in campaigns and bring your issues to the forefront!

We advise those not used to walking to start with the easier walks to assess their fitness level. We also organise social events in the winter months. These are held at Wigan Cricket Club off Parsons Walk in Wigan and start at 8.15 pm each week. We are always keen to welcome new members. We charge a £10 annual membership fee which entitles members to go on any of the guided walks including those using a coach to reach the start of the walk. There is an additional charge of £10 per person when using the coach. At other times we use our own transport. It is customary to make a nominal contribution to the driver towards fuel costs.',NULL,'','https://www.facebook.com/WiganRamblingAndClimbingClub',1,150,1,1,53.550641,-2.637151,'eng','2013-05-20 12:00:00','2013-05-20 12:00:00',NULL,NULL,'wigan-rambling-and-climbing-club',NULL,NULL,'2015-03-05 16:03:01'),(317,343,'Get Active Wigan and Leigh',NULL,'Robin Park Indoor Sports Centre','Loire Drive',NULL,'Wigan','WN5 0UL','01942 488481','activeliving@wlct.org','http://www.getactivewiganandleigh.co.uk/','Active Living is part of Wigan Leisure & Culture Trust, and is responsible for helping people to become more physically active to improve their general health, well-being and quality of life.

We mainly meet in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://u3asitec.org.uk/live/code/u3asite.php?site=665&amp;page=2\">groups</a>, and these are very varied ranging from languages, literature, bridge, dancing, art, history, IT, plus many more. The groups are run and organised by members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0.5em\">We also hold quarterly open meetings at the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Riverside+Centre+Ltd/@50.70246,-1.290551,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xe838e14c6c180e1b\">Riverside Centre</a>, Newport. Visitors are welcome to come and listen to interesting speakers, meet members and enjoy free refreshments. Once a year we have an &#39;Open Day&#39; which is open to all. Group leaders run stalls so that they can share with everyone what goes on within their own groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0.5em\">We publish a quarterly&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.rogerskid.org.uk/iwu3a/news_flip/index.html\">newsletter</a>&nbsp;for all our members. This gives lots of information about our groups and keeps everyone informed. The annual membership fee is &pound;12 single or &pound;20 per couple. This gives access to as many groups as you wish (provided they have places).</p>\r\n','Various','','',1,150,1,1,50.7024596,-1.2905508000000099,'eng','2014-07-11 15:29:49','2014-09-03 15:15:36',NULL,NULL,'university-of-the-3rd-age',NULL,NULL,'2015-03-05 16:03:01'),(506,532,'Tai Chi Chaun','','Riverside Centre','The Quay','','ne','PO30 2QR','07891836295','tomasntraceysegrue@btinternet.com','','<p>Natural Balance, anyone, any age and any ability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contact: 01983 616953 / 07891836295</p>\r\n','Friday 10-11am','','',1,150,1,1,50.7024596,-1.2905508000000099,'eng','2014-07-11 15:35:15','2014-07-11 15:35:15',NULL,NULL,'tai-chi-chaun',NULL,NULL,'2015-03-05 16:03:01'),(507,533,'Badminton Club','Clayton Sheath ','Wroxall Community Centre, Station Road','','','Wroxall','PO38 3DP','856461','','','','Tues 10.30-12','','',1,150,1,1,50.6164776,-1.2213967000000099,'eng','2014-08-07 09:36:53','2014-08-07 09:36:53',NULL,NULL,'badminton-club',NULL,NULL,'2015-03-05 16:03:01'),(508,534,'Women\'s Institute','','Shorwell Parish Hall','','','Shorwell','PO30 3JR','524716','','','','2nd Monday of the month. 7.30pm.','','',1,150,0,1,50.6406755,-1.35504939999998,'eng','2014-08-07 10:06:21','2014-09-04 17:12:50',NULL,NULL,'women-s-institute',NULL,NULL,'2015-03-05 16:03:01'),(509,535,'Brighstone Women\'s Institute','Angela Russell ','Wilberforce Hall','','','Brighstone','PO30 4AX','740403','','','','Every 2nd Tuesday at 7.30pm','','',1,150,0,1,50.6436989,-1.39568299999996,'eng','2014-08-07 10:09:08','2014-09-04 17:12:31',NULL,NULL,'brighstone-women-s-institute',NULL,NULL,'2015-03-05 16:03:01'),(510,536,'Northwood Women\'s Institute','','Northwood WI Hall','364 Newport Rd','Cowes','','PO31 8PL','524716','','','','1st Thursday in the month, 2.00pm.

It can also improve breathing, movement, speech and confidence. It&#39;s fun and free and an opportunity to get out and meet people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SingAbout is based on the &lsquo;Singing for the Brain&rsquo; therapy, which was developed specifically for people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other dementia sufferers, as well as people whose brain functions are affected perhaps by a stroke or injury. &#39;Singing for the Brain&rsquo; is a trademarked therapy which has gained much recognition through studies undertaken with patients. It is recognised by the NHS as the most effective form of complementary therapy for this group and it works by stimulating, improving and maintaining the brain&rsquo;s neurological pathways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our SingAbout sessions, led by experienced practitioners, have a wider benefit to both carers and participants by providing group activity and encouraging social interaction. The sessions require group participation, and sometimes songs will be sung in rounds. Many of the songs require gentle hand actions or chair-based movements. Some are specifically chosen to invoke memories; some are previously unknown so participants are encouraged to memorise the words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No musical background is necessary so come along and try it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n','Weekly on a Monday from 2 -4 p.m','','',1,150,1,1,50.727324,-1.16922210000007,'eng','2014-08-11 00:20:30','2014-09-04 16:45:17',NULL,NULL,'independent-arts-singabout-1',NULL,NULL,'2015-03-05 16:03:02'),(658,684,'Island Flower Club','Kate Newcombe','Wootton Bridge Community Centre','Brannon Way ','Wootton Bridge ','Wootton','PO33 4NW','01983 564369','sue.gibbons@hotmail.com','http://www.nafas.org.uk/flower_club/Island+Flower+Club+(Ryde).html','','2nd Wed of each month at 2pm.

Both meet at 7.15pm for a 7.30pm start, the Ryde Club on a Monday evening, and the Newport Club on a Tuesday. Both play three games of Scrabble until 10pm. Both contain two main groups; an &quot;A&quot; group, playing &quot;Matchplay&quot; Scrabble using tournament rules taken from the ABSP, and a &quot;B&quot; group playing less competitive Scrabble for beginners, or simply for the more socially-minded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teams from both clubs take part in the Southern Counties&rsquo; League.</p>\r\n','every Monday evening, at 7.15pm ready for a 7.30 start','','',1,150,1,1,50.729454,-1.16150489999995,'eng','2014-08-11 17:36:20','2014-09-04 14:16:59',NULL,NULL,'scrabble-club',NULL,NULL,'2015-03-05 16:03:02'),(696,722,'Bembridge Afternoon TownsWomen  Guild','Mrs H Ransome','Bembridge Village Hall','High Street','','Bembridge','PO35 5XN','01983 874241','','','<p>The Isle of Wight Federation meets bi-monthly on the 4th Monday 10.15am at the Broadway Centre, Sandown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Federation, as well as supporting the eleven Island Guilds, hosts annually an Arts &amp; Crafts Exhibition, an inter-guild Quiz, both a Luncheon and a Christmas Concert.

We will then be able to provide each person with information specific to their own circumstances that will not only highlight the areas of their lifestyle that need attention, but we will be able to offer support tailored to their own situation in order to enable them to reduce their overall risk. This will be rolled out online and in store towards the end of August.</p>\r\n','','','',0,100,0,0,50.7224854,-1.8627033999999867,'eng','2015-01-20 16:48:45','2015-01-20 16:48:45',NULL,NULL,'the-sugar-aware-uk-deli-cafe',NULL,NULL,'2015-03-05 16:03:02'),(742,774,'Test service','','','','','Southampton','','','','','<p>Test service dscription</p>\r\n','','','',1,150,1,1,50.9234423,-1.4078461999999945,'eng','2015-03-05 14:39:45','2015-03-05 14:55:23',NULL,0,'test-service',NULL,NULL,'2015-03-05 16:03:02'),(743,776,'Test service','','','','','Bournemouth','','','','','<p>Test service description</p>\r\n','','','',3,163,1,1,50.9234423,-1.4078461999999945,'eng','2015-03-05 14:56:58','2015-03-05 14:56:58',NULL,0,'test-service-1',NULL,NULL,'2015-03-05 16:03:02'),(744,776,'Test service','','','','','Bournemouth','','','','','<p>Test service description</p>\r\n','','','',3,163,1,1,50.9234423,-1.4078461999999945,'eng','2015-03-05 14:56:58','2015-03-05 16:10:17',NULL,0,'test-service-1','1,7',NULL,'2015-03-05 16:10:17'),(745,774,'Test service edit by champion','Marcin','The Chapel','Cemetery Rd','','Southampton','SO15 7NN','02380333991','','','<p>Test service dscription</p>\r\n','','','',1,150,1,1,50.9234423,-1.4078461999999945,'eng','2015-03-05 14:39:45','2015-03-05 16:41:28',NULL,0,'test-service','1',NULL,'2015-03-05 16:41:28'),(746,778,'Another test service','','','','','','','','','','<p>Test service description</p>\r\n','','','',1,150,1,1,50.9234423,-1.4078461999999945,'eng','2015-03-05 16:50:09','2015-03-05 16:50:09',NULL,0,'another-test-service','1,7',NULL,'2015-03-05 16:50:09'),(747,505,'Over 60\'s Group ','','Lord Louis Library','','','Newport','PO30 1LL','527655','','','<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:217pt\">\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style=\"height:30pt; width:217pt\">Tea and chat</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n','Every other Monday ','','',60,150,1,1,50.6978201,-1.29365089999999,'eng','2014-07-11 10:43:33','2015-10-21 11:59:40',NULL,0,'over-60-s-group','25',NULL,'2015-10-21 11:59:40'),(748,577,'Health Walks','Richard Dent ','Northwood House House Car Park, Ward Avenue','','','Cowes','PO31 8AZ','822099 ex. 6246','','https://vimeo.com/143142870','<p>All walks lead by trained volunteer and are fairly level.
